FreeCol Artwork
---------------

These are the source files for the graphics in FreeCol, including the
photoshop/paintshop files and in some cases rendered png's.  

I originally used jasc paintshop pro 7, but I've switched to photoshop
6.  I can give you access to these files if you want.  It will have to
be on my web server, I haven't been able to get an ftp srever to work
properly.  The primary things to consider for terrain items is the shape
and size of the tiles (I have a template for this) and colours being in
the same range as the rest of the tiles (this was actually applied
midway through the creation of graphics, so it's not as neat - ah well).

Cheers,
Stephen
